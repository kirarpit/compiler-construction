spike4-10 LOBO-C LEGAL TYPE PROPAGATIONS

GIVEN:

    X, Y, Z : Arbitrary distinct types

    P, Q :    Arbitrary distinct pointer types

    A, D :    Arbitrary distinct array types

    U, S, B:  unsigned, signed, and bool, respectively

    M, N:     Arbitrary distinct numeric types (either U, S, or B)

ALL OPERAND TYPE-OPERATOR COMBINATIONS NOT COVERED BELOW ARE ILLEGAL

---
OP: pre unary --, ++; post unary --, ++

  OP U => U          U OP => U
  OP S => S          S OP => S
  OP P => P          P OP => P

---
OP: post unary []

  P[] => (type that P points to)

---
OP: post [expr]

  A[M] => (type that A is array of)

---
OP: unary - 

  OP U => U     (Even though overflow is implied)
  OP S => S

---
OP: unary &

  &X => X[]     (But the type X value must be addressable)

---
OP: binary +, -, *, /

 U OP U => U
 U OP S => U
 S OP U => U
 S OP S => S

---
OP: binary <, <=, >, >=

 U OP U => B
 S OP S => B
 P OP P => B

---
OP: binary ==, !=

 X OP X => B
 M OP N => B

---
OP: logical &&, ||

  B OP B => B

---
OP: ?:

  B ? X : X  => X

---
OP: binary assignment =

  S = M => S
  U = M => U
  B = M => B
  P = P => P
